    "The field of Numerical Analysis is really the study of how to take mathematical problems and perform them efficiently and accurately on a computer. While the field of numerical analysis is quite powerful and wide-reaching, there are some mathematical problems where numerical analysis doesn’t make much sense (e.g. finding an algebraic derivative of a function, proving a theorem, uncovering a pattern in a sequence). However, for many problems a numerical method that gives an approximate answer is both more efficient and more versatile than any analytic technique. Let’s look at several examples. You can also watch a short introduction video here: https://youtu.be/yH0zhca0hbs"
