    "> In the 1950s and 1960s, the founding fathers of Numerical Analysis discovered that inexact arithmetic can be a source of danger, causing errors in results that 'ought' to be right. The source of such problems is numerical instability: that is, the amplification of rounding errors from microscopic to macroscopic scale by certain modes of computation.''\n",

    "The field of Numerical Analysis is really the study of how to take mathematical problems and perform them efficiently and accurately on a computer. While the field of numerical analysis is quite powerful and wide-reaching, there are some mathematical problems where numerical analysis doesn’t make much sense (e.g. finding an algebraic derivative of a function, proving a theorem, uncovering a pattern in a sequence). However, for many problems a numerical method that gives an approximate answer is both more efficient and more versatile than any analytic technique. Let’s look at several examples. You can also watch a short introduction video here: https://youtu.be/yH0zhca0hbs"

This last goal is one of the big takeaways from numerical analysis: we can mathematically model highly complicated functions out of fairly simple pieces.\n",

    "The great thing about Taylor Series is that they allow for the representation of potentially very complicated functions as polynomials – and polynomials are easily dealt with on a computer since they involve only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and integer powers. The down side is that the order of the polynomial is infinite. Hence, every time we use a Taylor series on a computer we are actually going to be using a **Truncated Taylor Series** where we only take a finite number of terms.
