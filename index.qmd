Welcome to *Numerical Methods in Applied Mathematics, with Python*!

In this course, you'll explore Python programming through interactive lessons. 
Each week includes examples and a link to open the lesson directly in Google Colab. If you choose, you can also download the `.ipynb` files and work on them locally.
